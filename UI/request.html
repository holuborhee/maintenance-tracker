      <h3>A.C. developed technical issue</h3>
      <p>
        I was doing nothing with the A.c for twelve months, but yesterday. I needed it and I switched it on, it worked well, switched it off after three hours of use, but when I switched it on this morning, it wouldn't work. I have checked every connection including the mains, every other appliance in the house works well too, this needs an urgent fix, as I will still be receiving visitors today.
